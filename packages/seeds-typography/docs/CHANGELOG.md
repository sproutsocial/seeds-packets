## Changelog

### v0.4.2
- **Fixed** Fixed documentation of Javascript tokens. Were showing objects for all values, but only type scale values are objects; the rest of the values are simple constants.

### v0.4.1

- **Deprecated** The Sketch Text Styles plugin has not been updated for the latest versions of Sketch. It has been removed from the docs until another solution is determined.

### v0.4.0

- **New** For better cross-browser fallbacks and to solve issues like odd emoji rendering, our official font stacks should default to system fonts like San Francisco.
- **Updated** Shows Sass vars instead of mixins for font size and font weight values
