## Usage

### Best Practices

- Use primary buttons to call attention to an action on a form, or highlight the strongest call to action on a page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header or in a modal dialog). Keep in mind that not every screen needs a primary button.
- Use secondary buttons for actions of lesser importance than the strongest call to action on a page. Secondary buttons will be the standard button for most use cases.
- Use ghost button for actions of the least importance than the strongest call to action on a page, destructive actions such as "Cancel", or to discourage usage.
- Primary, secondary, and ghost buttons can consist of text only, an icon only, or a combination of text and an icon.
- On hover, contrast should increase. Secondary buttons become filled.
- Opacity on disabled buttons is 40%.

### Do’s and Don’ts

- **DO:** Use title case.

- **DO:** Use Red 700 for destructive actions
    ![Destructive button]({{{siteUrl}}}/assets/SEEDS-buttons-destructive.svg)
- **DO:** Place icons before text unless using a carat. Carats link to information on a new page or not immediately displayed.
- **DO:** Increase contrast on hover.
- **DON’T:** Use network colors.
