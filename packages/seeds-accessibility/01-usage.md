## Practice

### Accessibility Compliance Goals

- For all of Sprout's web apps, we strive to achieve the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA level of compliance. This ensures:
  - that we are reaching our widest-possible audience
  - we have the ability to sell to institutions that receive federal funding
  - our company values are an integral part of how we build our products

### Best Practices

- Accessibility is for everyone.
	- Accessibility is about ensuring _equal access_ to our platforms for all peoples.
	- This does include people with disabilities but also benefits many other aspects such as personal preference, power users, SEO and more.
	- Thus, we approach Accessibility with Universal Design, rather than "othering" sequestered experiences just for those with disabilities.

### Do’s and Don’ts

- **DO:** Use the native browser `outline` on focus

- **DO:** Consider Accessibility practices as a continuous responsibility for all team members
- **DON'T:** Allow Accessibility features to be an after-thought
- **DO:** Understand expected keyboard navigation before beginning development.
- **DO:** Understand what parts of the feature/product need to be read aloud for Screen Readers, and which parts are decorations that need no explanation.
