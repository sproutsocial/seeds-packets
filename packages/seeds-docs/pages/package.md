### Overview
An overview is a brief summary of the package and it's importance.
 
### Examples
Examples are a demonstration of a theme comprised of imagery or code (tokens).

### Tokens
Tokens are named entities that store visual design attributes. 

Using our typography scale as an example, 'Size 100' is a token that contains the visual design attributes font-size and line-height. 

### Usage
A set of guidelines that help you use the contents of a package successfully in your work. 

Here are some common ways to communicate usage to help you get started:

 - Visual Best Practices
 - Content Best Practices
 - Accessibility Best Practices
 - Dos and Don'ts
 
Imagery can be used to support usage guidelines when appropriate.

### Resources
Assets, tools, or other materials provided as part of a package to improve efficiency and support your everyday workflow.

## Stages
The completion of a package is defined by three stages, Alpha, Beta and Stable. To create a package you must submit at least an overview. Anything published to SEEDS is deemed trustworthy, as it has been peer reviewed and approved by a trusted panel of designers. Below are the different levels of a package's maturity and what they mean.

### Alpha
Exists in SEEDS. This is the growth stage.
 
### Beta
The package includes usable tokens and code. This is the validation and testing phase.

### Stable
A package that is being confidently used in all verticals. This is the mature stage.
