<p class="Lead">
There are a couple of ways you can contribute to SEEDS to help us maintain and grow the system. It's important to understand that with everyone's help we can create a powerful resource for our organization. Whether directly or indirectly, contribution is easy and allows you to shape the way we approach design.

## Direct Contribution
Any form of interaction with SEEDS that consumes or modifies the system.

### Consuming
Simply using SEEDS informs better decision making for our constantly evolving system.

Here are some examples of how you can use SEEDS in your work:

 - Use a package in production code.
 - Use a package as a reference to educate yourself or team to help
   inform decisions.
 - Validate and test a package through design.

### Pull Request
Submit a pull request in GitHub to modify a package. The pull request is peer reviewed after submission and requires approval before it is merged into SEEDS and your update is live.

## Indirect Contribution
Any form of feedback provided to the SEEDS team.

### Feedback Channels
These are the best ways to include the SEEDS team in any discussion about the system:

 - Mention @SEEDS in Slack.
 - Mention @SEEDS on GitHub.
 - Email the team at seeds@sproutsocial.com.

### Submit Ticket
Click the “Submit SEEDS Ticket” link in the sidebar to create a JIRA ticket for the SEEDS team to propose adding a new package or modifying an existing one. This is a great first step to initiate direct contribution to the system.

### Surveys
Participation in surveys when prompted by the SEEDS team is a very helpful way for us collect valuable data as we track progress, system usage, and team goals.

### Guild Meeting
A periodic “town hall” style open forum where the SEEDS team can gather ideas and opinions about particular high impact topics.
