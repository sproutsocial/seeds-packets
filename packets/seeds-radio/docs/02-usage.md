## Usage

### Guidelines

- Use sentence case for writing labels, be clear and concise
- Use positive clear language so it's clear what happens when a user clicks on the checkbox.
- Avoid negations such as “Don’t send me more emails”, which would mean that the user would have to check the box in order for something not to happen.
- The default view for checkboxes has no option selected.
- Checkbox options should be listed according to a logical order (alphabetical, numerical, time-based, etc).
